## Objective

A clear and concise description of what will be implemented and why.

What are we doing and why? What problem will this solve? What are the goals and
non-goals? This is your executive summary; keep it short, elaborate below.

## Motivation

Why this is a valuable problem to solve? What background information is needed
to show how this design addresses the problem?

Which users are affected by the problem? Why is it a problem? What data supports
this? What related work exists?

## User Benefit

How will users (or other contributors) benefit from this work? What would be the
headline in the release notes or blog post?

## Design Proposal

This is the meat of the document, where you explain your proposal. If you have
multiple alternatives, be sure to use sub-sections for better separation of the
idea, and list pros/cons to each approach. If there are alternatives that you
have eliminated, you should also list those here, and explain why you believe
your chosen approach is superior.

Factors to consider include:

* performance implications
* dependencies
* maintenance
* platforms and environments impacted (e.g. hardware, cloud, other software
  ecosystems)
* compatibility
* user impact (how will this change impact users, and how will that be managed?)
* codebase impact (will this require a lot of changes in the codebase or change how something operates?)
* alternative solutions (divide this into sections)
* concerns (challenges? deadlines? dependencies?)

If convenient add images, diagrams, code snippets.

## Detailed Design

This section is optional. Elaborate on details if theyâ€™re important to
understanding the design, but would make it hard to read the proposal section
above.
